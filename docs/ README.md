## Project Management Overview

**OctoAcme delivers cross-functional projects using a standardized process that embraces:**

- Customer-first delivery and a focus on usability
- Iterative, measurable progress with small, testable increments
- Clearly defined roles:
  - Project Manager (PM)
  - Product Manager (PdM)
  - Developer
  - QA/Tester
  - Stakeholder
- Prioritized backlogs and roadmap alignment
- Proactive risk management and stakeholder communication routines
- Data-informed decision-making and continuous improvement

**Lifecycle Phases:**
1. **Initiation**: Validate need, align stakeholders, define goals and metrics, and set high-level timeline.
2. **Planning**: Scope breakdown, backlog creation, risk and dependency identification, timeline and milestone alignment.
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, iterate, and report progress. Track via standups and progress boards.
4. **Release & Deployment**: Meet release criteria, deploy stages, verify, and communicate broadly.
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings, identify improvements, and implement action items for the next cycle.

**Communication:**
- Weekly PM/PdM sync
- Team standups (twice a week or as needed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations following a documented path
